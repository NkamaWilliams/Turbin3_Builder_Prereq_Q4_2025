# Turbin3 Builder's Cohort - Q4 2025 Prereq

### Thoughts on the question: Why do you think Solana has chosen during most of its history to use Typescript for Client side development?
---

Off the top of my head, I believe it should be because of the web. To me most blockchains are simply specialised distributed systems that people interact with through the web. Because of its close relationship with the web, the best way to make it accessible to the most people is to enable its client side interactions (which is what most people will use) to be in the language that most denizens of the web will know. Which, is this case is JavaScript / TypeScript. If it had chosen to use say .NET for its client side development, then it would have immediately excluded the vast majority of web developers from being able to easily build with it. Anyway, haven't done any research on this, but I think it may have influenced their decision to use TS.
